{"name":"Kansa","tagline":"A Powershell incident response framework","body":"Kansa\r\n=====\r\n\r\nA modular incident response framework in Powershell. \r\n\r\n##What does it do? \r\nIt uses Powershell Remoting to run user contributed, ahem, user contributed modules across hosts in an enterprise to collect data for use during incident response, breach hunts, or for building an environmental baseline.  \r\n\r\n##How do you use it?  \r\nHere's a very simple command line example you can run on your own local host.  \r\n  \r\n1.  After downloading the project and unzipping it, you'll likely need to \"unblock\" the ps1 files. The easiest way to do this if you're using Powershell v3 or later is to cd to the directory where Kansa resides and do:  \r\n```Powershell\r\nls -r *.ps1 | Unblock-File\r\n```\r\nIf you're not running PS v3 or later, Sysinternal's Streams utility can be used to remove the alternate data streams that Powershell uses to determine if files came from the Internet. Once you've removed those ADSes, you'll be able to run the scripts without issue.  \r\n\r\nI've not run into any issues running the downloaded scripts via Windows Remote Management / Powershell Remoting through Kansa, so you shouldn't have to do anything if you want to run the scripts via remoting.  \r\n\r\n2.  Open an elevated Powershell Prompt (Right-click Run As Administrator)  \r\n3.  At the command prompt, enter: \r\n```Powershell\r\n.\\kansa.ps1 -Target localhost -ModulePath .\\Modules -Verbose  \r\n```\r\nThe script should start collecting data or you may see an error about not having Windows Remote Management enabled. If so, do a little searching online, it's easy to turn on. Turn it on and try again. When it finishes running, you'll have a new Output_timestamp subdirectory, with subdirectories for data collected by each module. You can cd into those subdirectories and checkout the data. There are some analysis scripts in the Analysis directory, but many of those won't make sense  \r\non a collection of data from a single host. Kansa was written for collection and analysis of data from dozens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of systems.  \r\n\r\n##Running Modules Standalone  \r\nKansa modules can be run as standalone utilities outside of the Kansa framework. Why might you want to do this? Consider netstat -naob, the output of the command line utility is ugly and doesn't easily lend itself to analysis. Running  \r\n```Powershell\r\nModules\\Net\\Get-Netstat.ps1\r\n```\r\nas a standalone script will call netstat -naob, but it will return Powershell objects in an easy to read, easy to analyze format. You can easily convert its output to CSV, TSV or XML using normal Powershell cmdlets. Here's an example:  \r\n```Powershell\r\n.\\Get-Netstat.ps1 | ConvertTo-CSV -Delimiter \"`t\" -NoTypeInformation | % { $_ -replace \"`\"\" } | Set-Content netstat.tsv\r\n```\r\nthe result of the above will be a file called netstat.tsv containing unquoted, tab separate values for netstat -naob's output.\r\n\r\n##Caveats:\r\nPowershell relies on the Windows API. Your adversary may use subterfuge.*\r\n\r\n* Collectors can be written to bypass the Windows API as well -- Get-RekallPslist.ps1 for example.\r\n\r\n##Version notes:  \r\nIt's been tested in PSv2 / .NET 2 and later and works mostly without issue, PSv2 doesn't support workflows and some collectors do use workflows. Trouble is, in PSv2, workflow code throws an error when the scripts are parsed, before execution begins. The fix, comment out the workflows. :(  \r\n\r\nReally, upgrade to PSv3 or later. Be happy.  \r\n\r\n##More info:  \r\nhttp://trustedsignal.blogspot.com/search/label/Kansa  \r\nhttp://www.powershellmagazine.com/2014/07/18/kansa-a-powershell-based-incident-response-framework/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
