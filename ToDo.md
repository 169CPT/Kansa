1. Automate some quick analysis over results (i.e. compare file sizes, number of lines)
2. Rewrite netstat module to return objects so it works correctly with Export-Csv
3. Add module configuration support, allow users to specify the order of collection as well as specific modules
4. Add support for $Credential
5. Finish porting all existing collectors in Mal-Seine
6. Add support for binary dependencies (i.e. Autoruns, Handle)
7. Figure out if there's a way to resolve non-log related GUIDs in SvcTrigs to human readable equivalents
